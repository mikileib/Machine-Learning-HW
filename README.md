# ML Homework Repository

This repository contains the homework assignments for the Machine Learning course. Each assignment involves building and evaluating machine learning models using different datasets. Below are the details for each assignment.

## Assignment 1: Student Performance Index

### Objective
Build models to predict students' performance using the "Student Performance Dataset," which includes various student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features.

### Dataset
- **Source**: Download from Moodle.
- **Description**: This dataset includes student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features.
- **Target Variable**: 'G3' (students' final year grades).

### Tasks
1. **Linear Regression Model**: Predict the students' final year grade.
2. **Classification Model**: Predict if the students' final year performance will be above average.

### Files
- `ML_DL_Assignment1.ipynb`: Main assignment notebook.
- `ML_DL_Functions1.py`: Utility functions file.
- `student-por.csv`: Dataset file (ensure this is in the same directory in Google Drive).

## Assignment 2: Music Century Classification

### Objective
Construct models to predict the century in which a music piece was released using the "YearPredictionMSD Data Set."

### Dataset
- **Source**: Download from Moodle (not from UCI).
- **Description**: Derived from the Million Song Dataset.
- **Links for Reference**:
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/yearpredictionmsd)
  - [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/tasks-demos/#yearrecognition)

### Tasks
1. **Model Training**: Predict the release century of music pieces.

### Files
- `ML_DL_Assignment2.ipynb`: Main assignment notebook.
- `ML_DL_Functions2.py`: Utility functions file.
- `YearPredictionMSD.txt`: Dataset file (ensure this is in the same directory in Google Drive).

## Assignment 3: Image Classification

### Objective
Build a convolutional neural network to predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or different pairs.

### Tasks
1. **Model Construction**: Explore two convolutional architectures to achieve the task.

### Files
- `ML_DL_Assignment3.ipynb`: Main assignment notebook.
- `ML_DL_Functions3.py`: Utility functions file.
- Model parameters:
  - `best_CNN_model.pk`
  - `best_CNNChannel_model.pk`
