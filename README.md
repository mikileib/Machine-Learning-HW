ML Homework Repository
This repository contains the homework assignments for the Machine Learning course. Each assignment involves building and evaluating machine learning models using different datasets. Below are the details for each assignment.

Assignment 1: Student Performance Index
Objective
Build models to predict students' performance using the "Student Performance Dataset," which includes various student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features.

Dataset
Source: Download from Moodle.
Description: This dataset includes student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features.
Target Variable: 'G3' (students' final year grades).
Tasks
Linear Regression Model: Predict the students' final year grade.
Classification Model: Predict if the students' final year performance will be above average.
Files
ML_DL_Assignment1.ipynb: Main assignment notebook.
ML_DL_Functions1.py: Utility functions file.
student-por.csv: Dataset file (ensure this is in the same directory in Google Drive).
Assignment 2: Music Century Classification
Objective
Construct models to predict the century in which a music piece was released using the "YearPredictionMSD Data Set."

Dataset
Source: Download from Moodle (not from UCI).
Description: Derived from the Million Song Dataset.
Links for Reference:
UCI Machine Learning Repository
